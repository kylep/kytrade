"""Questrade API"""

# Honestly the first step of setting this up is to agree to their terms of use, which make you
# agree not to place any trades using the API. Weird since it seems to have endpoints for it, but
# I read that ib_insync for IBKR is easier than the straight TWS API so I'm gonna go try that
# first. Plus I'm not eager to get stuck paying Questrade's comissions if I algo trade.
